<h1>Assumptions</h1>

<p>First of all, to calculate the moment of inertia of the rocket about a central disk, we estimated the rocket to be a blunt, long cylinder of uniform density with no nose cone. This was mainly because the actual number of components of a rocket and their individual geometries and densities is much too complex to calculate, even if we knew all these numbers. Second, it made dealing with aerodynamic forces and tipping forces from an angle of attack very easy to deal with, as this assumption allows us to place the Center of Gravity (CG) at the geometric center of the rocket, because a regular cylinder has a cross section of a rectangle.

We also chose to disregard the effect of roll on a rocket, for several reasons. First ofa ll, the physics of windflow at supersonic speeds on surfaces that aren't computationally modeled is very hard to predict, and this comes into play when the rocket is rotating about its axis and the fins themselves are plowing through the air. Also, when thinking about how to determine which fins needed to be activated, we realized that, unless we could produce an immense amount of linear algebra code on the rotation of two coordinate systems relative to each other</p>
